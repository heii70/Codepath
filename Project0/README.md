## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Keeping track of the input values after submitting the form took some time to figure out. Creating the radio buttons using a loop was a hassle having to keep track of the html echo statements. Figuring how to implement custom tip percent took the longest but was the most rewarding when my solution worked.
